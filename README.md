Stayze is an online market for providing lodging or primary homestays. The company does not own any real estate or properties, it acts as a broker receiving commission from each booking. The hosts rent out their property, its availability, area, type of room, price etc. and the travellers can book accordingly. The travellers put in their reviews, which is visible to others. 
Data can be used to gain business insights, make decisions, improve security, understand the customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
